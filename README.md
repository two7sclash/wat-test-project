# The Namegame

For my version of the Namegame, I went with Option #2. My "better way" is to set up the game as a proper React app, with a modern build process via Node. Up to this point, I have only done React tutorials, so this is my first non-trival, novel React app. I used my eight hours to get it working to my liking, without, hopefully, taking any cheap shortcuts or using obvious anti-patterns. Rather than showing some sort of mastery of the library, my work here shows how quickly I can ramp up to new tech.
