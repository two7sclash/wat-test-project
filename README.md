# The Namegame

Leading scientists have proven, via science, that learning your coworkers names while starting a new job is useful. Your test project is make it happen! We have a simple version hosted at [namegame.willowtreemobile.com](http://namegame.willowtreemobile.com/) which you can test. The api is located at [namegame.willowtreemobile.com/api/game:2000](http://namegame.willowtreemobile.com/api/game).

## Option 1

Present the user with 5 number of faces and ask them to identify the listed name. This is essentially what is working already. To spruce things up, implementing a few features of your choice.

1. Stat tracking. How many correct / incorrect attempts did the user make? How long does it take on average for a person to identify the subject?
2. Reverse mode, Show 5 names with one picture.
3. Keyboard shortcuts. Power users love keyboard shortcuts, maybe add numbers for faces for mouse free fun. Bonus points for VIM shortcuts.
4. Local Scoring. The server might not accept scores, but you can always track it locally. Make metrics of your own and have a leader board!
5. Mat(t) Mode. Roughly 90% of our co-workers are named Mat(t), add a challenge mode where you only present the users with A Mat(t).
6. Gender mode. We don't provide gender data, but you could always implement an algorithm to either parse names of faces and guess if the subject is a boy or girl. You could then have boy / girl mode for super bonus points! Shoot for the moon and if you miss you will simply float through space for eternity.
7. Insert your idea own here!
